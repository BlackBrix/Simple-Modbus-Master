# Simple-Modbus-Master
## A simple Modbus Master Arduino Library  
(Original by Juan Bester  --> https://goo.gl/9au7R1)  
  
you can use it with the Simple Modbus Slave Library --> https://github.com/BlackBrix/Simple-Modbus-Slave
  
see as well: https://github.com/angeloc/simplemodbusng for a more developed and maintained variant of this library

I have decided to rewrite some of the library to create easier abstraction and to add functions 5 and 6. I have also created a manual of sorts with lots of information to help getting started. I have also shared a link on my drive to all my communication information. The ones in question are modbus and RS485. It makes for a very good (and long) read. The library for the DUE differs only in the removal of the byteFornat parameter in modbus_configure().

Minor changes in the keywords.txt file.

Cleaned up comments and changed the BUFFER size to 64 which matches the new buffer value in the hardwareSerial core library in version 1.05 onwards.
